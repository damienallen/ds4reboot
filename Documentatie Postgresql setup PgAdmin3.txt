Open pgAdmin 3
Create database (preferrably named 'ds4db')
Make sure a database is added with default settings (preferrably called ds4db and connect to it)
Open psql console (for entering commands into postgresql)

Add the user 'ds4db' with your password (preferrably randomized).
Store the password in secret_settings.py or whatever matching server password storage.
To add user, type following into psql:
	CREATE USER ds4db_user WITH PASSWORD 'RaNdOmPaSsWoRd';
Make sure that all privilages are set for this user as follows:
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE ds4db TO ds4db_user
Quit psql with '\q'

Perform django database migration as follows:
Run 'python manage.py migrate' (this assumes you have pulled the website from github to a local folder)
Now you have an empty database.

Insert data fixture from any dump (now called dumpABC.json):
Run 'python manage.py loaddata dumpABC.json'

In case of errors, save the dump file in ANSI type (not UTF-16, this has a wrong starting byte).
