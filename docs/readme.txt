install

- pgAdmin 3 + postgreSQL 9.4 from
	https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads
	(make sure you don't download pgAdmin 4, postgres 9.5+ because those don't work and are completely different)

- git interface: sourcetree (atlassian account required, but real nice GUI)? Github desktop (sucky?) Command line git?
	Make sure you setup your name so commits become clearer: no 'unknown-user' commits
	Clone the repo from ds4reboot: https://github.com/studentenhuisDS4/ds4reboot
	Get secret_settings.py from someone.

- download pycharm as student
	ds4reboot likes python 3.6/3.7 or higher
	-> make sure pgadmin database is added (ds4db) for role (ds4db_user)
	-> see installation_pics folder for the rest
